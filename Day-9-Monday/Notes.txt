Binary Search Working:

Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in two ways which are discussed below.

Iterative Method
Recursive Method
The recursive method follows the divide and conquer approach.

The general steps for both methods are discussed below.

The array in which searching is to be performed is:
initial array Binary Search
Initial array

Let x = 4 be the element to be searched.
Set two pointers low and high at the lowest and the highest positions respectively.
setting pointers Binary Search
Setting pointers
Find the middle element mid of the array ie. arr[(low + high)/2] = 6.
mid element Binary Search
Mid element
If x == mid, then return mid.Else, compare the element to be searched with m.
If x > mid, compare x with the middle element of the elements on the right side of mid. This is done by setting low to low = mid + 1.
Else, compare x with the middle element of the elements on the left side of mid. This is done by setting high to high = mid - 1.
finding mid element Binary Search
Finding mid element
Repeat steps 3 to 6 until low meets high.
mid element Binary Search
Mid element
x = 4 is found.
found Binary Search
Found

Working of Bubble Sort
Suppose we are trying to sort the elements in ascending order.

1. First Iteration (Compare and Swap)

Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements.
If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped.
Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order.
The above process goes on until the last element.
Compare two adjacent elements and swap them if the first element is greater than the next element
Compare the Adjacent Elements
2. Remaining Iteration

The same process goes on for the remaining iterations.

After each iteration, the largest element among the unsorted elements is placed at the end.

Continue the swapping and put the largest element among the unsorted list at the end
Put the largest element at the end
In each iteration, the comparison takes place up to the last unsorted element.

Swapping occurs only if the first element is greater than the next element
Compare the adjacent elements
The array is sorted when all the unsorted elements are placed at their correct positions.

The array is sorted if all the elements are kept in the right order.
The array is sorted if all elements are kept in the right order
Bubble Sort Algorithm
bubbleSort(array)
  for i <- 1 to indexOfLastUnsortedElement-1
    if leftElement > rightElement
      swap leftElement and rightElement
end bubbleSort

1. Time Complexities
Worst Case Complexity: O(n2)
If we want to sort in ascending order and the array is in descending order then the worst case occurs.
Best Case Complexity: O(n)
If the array is already sorted, then there is no need for sorting.
Average Case Complexity: O(n2)
It occurs when the elements of the array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).
2. Space Complexity
Space complexity is O(1) because an extra variable is used for swapping.
In the optimized bubble sort algorithm, two extra variables are used. Hence, the space complexity will be O(2).
Bubble Sort Applications
Bubble sort is used if
complexity does not matter
short and simple code is preferred


A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node consists of 3 components:

*prev - address of the previous node
data - data item
*next - address of next node
A doubly linked list node
A doubly linked list node
Note: Before you proceed further, make sure to learn about pointers and structs.

Representation of Doubly Linked List
Let's see how we can represent a doubly linked list on an algorithm/code. Suppose we have a doubly linked list:

Newly created doubly linked list
Newly created doubly linked list
Here, the single node is represented as

struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *next;
    struct node *prev;
}
Each struct node has a data item, a pointer to the previous struct node, and a pointer to the next struct node.

For node one: next stores the address of two and prev stores null (there is no node before it)
For node two: next stores the address of three and prev stores the address of one
For node three: next stores null (there is no node after it) and prev stores the address of two.

1. Insertion at the Beginning
Let's add a node with value 6 at the beginning of the doubly linked list we made above.

1. Create a new node

allocate memory for newNode
assign the data to newNode.
New node
New node
2. Set prev and next pointers of new node

point next of newNode to the first node of the doubly linked list
point prev to null
Reorganize the pointers
Reorganize the pointers (changes are denoted by purple arrows)
3. Make new node as head node

Point prev of the first node to newNode (now the previous head is the second node)
Point head to newNode
Reorganize the pointers
Reorganize the pointers
Code for Insertion at the Beginning
// insert node at the front
void insertFront(struct Node** head, int data) {

    // allocate memory for newNode
    struct Node* newNode = new Node;

    // assign data to newNode
    newNode->data = data;

    // point next of newNode to the first node of the doubly linked list
    newNode->next = (*head);

    // point prev to NULL
    newNode->prev = NULL;

    // point previous of the first node (now first node is the second node) to newNode
    if ((*head) != NULL)
        (*head)->prev = newNode;

    // head points to newNode
    (*head) = newNode;
}
2. Insertion in between two nodes
Let's add a node with value 6 after node with value 1 in the doubly linked list.

1. Create a new node

allocate memory for newNode
assign the data to newNode.
New node
New node
2. Set the next pointer of new node and previous node

assign the value of next from previous node to the next of newNode
assign the address of newNode to the next of previous node
Reorganize the pointers
Reorganize the pointers
3. Set the prev pointer of new node and the next node

assign the value of prev of next node to the prev of newNode
assign the address of newNode to the prev of next node
Reorganize the pointers
Reorganize the pointers
The final doubly linked list is after this insertion is:

Final list
Final list
Code for Insertion in between two Nodes
// insert a node after a specific node
void insertAfter(struct Node* prev_node, int data) {

    // check if previous node is NULL
    if (prev_node == NULL) {
        cout << "previous node cannot be NULL";
        return;
    }

    // allocate memory for newNode
    struct Node* newNode = new Node;

    // assign data to newNode
    newNode->data = data;

    // set next of newNode to next of prev node
    newNode->next = prev_node->next;

    // set next of prev node to newNode
    prev_node->next = newNode;

    // set prev of newNode to the previous node
    newNode->prev = prev_node;

    // set prev of newNode's next to newNode
    if (newNode->next != NULL)
        newNode->next->prev = newNode;
}
3. Insertion at the End
Let's add a node with value 6 at the end of the doubly linked list.

1. Create a new node

New node
New node
2. Set prev and next pointers of new node and the previous node

If the linked list is empty, make the newNode as the head node. Otherwise, traverse to the end of the doubly linked list and

The final doubly linked list looks like this.

Code for Insertion at the End
// insert a newNode at the end of the list
void insertEnd(struct Node** head, int data) {
    // allocate memory for node
    struct Node* newNode = new Node;

    // assign data to newNode
    newNode->data = data;

    // assign NULL to next of newNode
    newNode->next = NULL;

    // store the head node temporarily (for later use)
    struct Node* temp = *head;

    // if the linked list is empty, make the newNode as head node
    if (*head == NULL) {
        newNode->prev = NULL;
        *head = newNode;
        return;
    }

    // if the linked list is not empty, traverse to the end of the linked list
    while (temp->next != NULL)
        temp = temp->next;

    // now, the last node of the linked list is temp
  // point the next of the last node (temp) to newNode.
    temp->next = newNode;

    // assign prev of newNode to temp
    newNode->prev = temp;
}

1. Delete the First Node of Doubly Linked List
If the node to be deleted (i.e. del_node) is at the beginning

Reset value node after the del_node (i.e. node two)

Reorganize the pointers
Reorganize the pointers
Finally, free the memory of del_node. And, the linked will look like this

Final list
Final list
Code for Deletion of the First Node

if (*head == del_node)
    *head = del_node->next;

if (del_node->prev != NULL)
    del_node->prev->next = del_node->next;

free(del);
2. Deletion of the Inner Node
If del_node is an inner node (second node), we must have to reset the value of next and prev of the nodes before and after the del_node.

For the node before the del_node (i.e. first node)

Assign the value of next of del_node to the next of the first node.

For the node after the del_node (i.e. third node)

Assign the value of prev of del_node to the prev of the third node.

Reorganize the pointers
Reorganize the pointers
Finally, we will free the memory of del_node. And, the final doubly linked list looks like this.

Code for Deletion of the Inner Node

if (del_node->next != NULL)
    del_node->next->prev = del_node->prev;

if (del_node->prev != NULL)
    del_node->prev->next = del_node->next;
3. Delete the Last Node of Doubly Linked List
In this case, we are deleting the last node with value 3 of the doubly linked list.

Here, we can simply delete the del_node and make the next of node before del_node point to NULL.

Reorganize the pointers
Reorganize the pointers
The final doubly linked list looks like this.

Final list
Final list
Code for Deletion of the Last Node

if (del_node->prev != NULL)
    del_node->prev->next = del_node->next;
Here, del_node ->next is NULL so del_node->prev->next = NULL.

Note: We can also solve this using the first condition (for the node before del_node) of the second case (Delete the inner node).

What is Matrix?

In mathematics, matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols or expressions arranged in the form of rows and columns. For example: if you take a matrix A which is a 2x3 matrix then it can be shown like this:

2       3          5
8       12        7
In Python, matrices can be implemented as nested list. Each element of the matrix is treated as a row. For example X = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]] would represent a 3x2 matrix. First row can be selected as X[0] and the element in first row, first column can be selected as X[0][0].


Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself. Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.
